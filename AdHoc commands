#By default Ansible searches for inverntory files in nearly four different location, list accroding to priority
$ANSIBLE_CONFIG           #searches in 'env' for this varaible
./ansible.cfg             #searches in the directory when ansible command is executed,it is used instead of the global file or the user's personal file.
~/.ansible.cfg            #searches in home directory
/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg  #This file is used if no other configuration file is found.


#Simple way to search the default location of config file is to run one of the below command's
ansible --version
ansible servers --list-hosts -v


#Settings in the Ansible configuration file

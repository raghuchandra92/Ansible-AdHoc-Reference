#Inventory variables that apply directly to hosts fall into two broad categories: host variables that apply to a specific host,
and group variables that apply to all hosts in a host group or in a group of host groups. 

#Host variables take precedence over group variables, but variables defined by a playbook take precedence over both.

#One way to define host variables and group variables is to do it directly in the inventory file.Among the disadvantages of 
this approach, it makes the inventory file more difficult to work with, mixes information about hosts and variables in the 
same file, and uses an obsolete syntax.

#The preferred approach is to create two directories in the same working directory as the inventory file or directory, 
group_vars and host_vars. These directories contain files defining group variables and host variables, respectively.

#The recommended practice is to define inventory variables using host_vars and group_vars directories, and not to define 
them directly in the inventory file or files.

# Ansible-AdHoc-Reference
This REPO is for Ansible AdHoc Quick reference just like cheatsheet. You can find all the components description in their folders, and quick reference for commands related to those components.

Most of the content/definitions is written with the help of RedHat's offical Ansible documentation

Playbooks/Modules are developed on my own, so please do double check if you want to use them 

Feel free to add/modify any playbook, modules here

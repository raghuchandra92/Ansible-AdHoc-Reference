PLAYBOOK
# A play is an ordered set of tasks which should be run against hosts selected from your inventory. A playbook is a text file 
that contains a list of one or more plays to run in order. Plays allow you to change a lengthy, complex set of manual 
administrative tasks into an easily repeatable routine with predictable and successful outcomes. In a playbook, you can 
save the sequence of tasks in a play into a human-readable and immediately runnable form. The tasks themselves, because of 
the way in which they are written, document the steps needed to deploy your application or infrastructure.





# A playbook is a text file written in YAML format, and is normally saved with the extension yml. The playbook primarily 
uses indentation with space characters to indicate the structure of its data. YAML doesn't place strict requirements on 
how many spaces are used for the indentation, but there are two basic rules.
• Data elements at the same level in the hierarchy (such as items in the same list) must have the
same indentation.
• Items that are children of another item must be indented more than their parents.
You can also add blank lines for readability.

#The order in which the plays and tasks are listed in a playbook is important, because Ansible runs them in the same order.

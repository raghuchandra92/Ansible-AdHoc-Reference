#Modules: Modules (also referred to as “task plugins” or “library plugins”) are discrete units of code that can be used 
from the command line or in a playbook task. Ansible executes each module, usually on the remote target node, and collects 
return values.

#Each module supports taking arguments. Nearly all modules take key=value arguments, space delimited. Some modules take 
no arguments, and the command/shell modules simply take the string of the command you want to run.
#All modules return JSON format data. This means modules can be written in any programming language.

#Most modules are idempotent, which means that they can be run safely multiple times, and if the
system is already in the correct state, they will do nothing.
